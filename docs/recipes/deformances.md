title: Deformances
chef: Monique Tschofen
abstract: Use large language models to deform poetic texts, exposing cultural logic through experimental transformation.
description: >
  Deformance brings together deforming and performance, describing a practice of deliberately "mishandling" or "mistreating" texts or datasets to generate new insights and perspectives. Coined by Jerome McGann and Lisa Samuels in 1999, the concept builds on avant-garde strategies like collage, Dadaist cut-ups, and OuLiPo algorithmic experiments. This recipe proposes digital deformance as a series of experiments that feed poetic or prose language into large language models for text, image, and sound generation. Rather than accepting bog-standard AI hyperrealism, this approach dives into surprising surrealist, expressionist, and uncanny modes, treating LLMs as experimental artifacts that perform and deform cultural memory. The method invites thinking beyond representationalism—poetic text prompts fed into sound generators won't necessarily yield literal representations. This critical engagement explicitly aims to destabilize and expose AI's logics, resisting nearly every affordance: leaning into labor visibility where AI reduces it, into complexity when it simplifies, into specificity where it generalizes. The goal is experimentation as resistance, betraying and exposing cultural logic to better avoid or manage it.

## Ingredients

- Large language models for text generation (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Text-to-image generators (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, etc.)
- Sound or music generators (optional)
- Source texts: poetic or prose language to deform
- Critical awareness of AI's harms and limitations
- Commitment to resisting AI's standard affordances

## Method

### Before You Cook: Critical Understanding of LLMs

**Important Warnings About AI:**

- Technology is resource-intensive (massive CO2 emissions and water usage)
- LLMs are riddled with biases
- Most LLMs trained unethically on copyrighted material
- AI being used in ways linked to fascism (Dan McQuillan)
- Any use of AI results in complicity with current AI regimes
- Any interaction trains the algorithm further

**Understanding AI's Harm Through Pattern Recognition:**

Jutta Treviranus identifies AI's fundamental problem: "In its most basic form, AI is a statistical reasoning machine that predicts and optimizes patterns found in available training data. AI amplifies, accelerates and automates these past patterns in the decisions and content it produces... AI is excellent at producing the typical, popular, normative, predictable, and statistically average. It is also effective at flagging the anomalous, diverging, and unfamiliar as candidates for suspicion."

**Eryk Salvaggio's Caution:**

"To steal Luke Stark's phrase, generative AI is plutonium. If you want to use it, consider nearly every possible option and every possible consequence before you commit to it as a tool. Any hope of using it well depends on resisting nearly every single affordance:
- Lean into labor visibility where it aims to reduce it
- Lean into complexity when it tries to simplify it
- Lean into specificity where it aims to generalize it
- Lean hard. Fight!"

**Golden Rule: Never Steal Anyone's Style**

Assiduously avoid prompts specifying "in the style of ___," especially living artists.

### The Deformance Approach

This recipe posits that as an avant-garde practice (as opposed to commercial practice), deformance holds critical possibilities. The goal: engage with LLMs critically, using experimentation as resistance that betrays and exposes cultural logic.

**Three Objectives:**

1. Demonstrate how text/image/sound LLMs are "experimental artifacts" that "perform" and "deform" cultural memory
2. Resist bog-standard AI aesthetics of hyperrealism; dive into surrealist, expressionist, uncanny modes
3. Think beyond representationalism—poetic prompts won't necessarily yield literal denotative representations
4. Frame the value of deformative experimentation in relation to what works uncover or reveal

### Sample Before You Cook: Examining Deformances

Before creating your own, study these examples of deformance in digital environments:

**Example 1: Mark Sample's "Hacking the Accident" (2012)**
http://web.archive.org/web/20150102212412/http://hacking.fugitivetexts.net:80/

An algorithmically-altered version of "Hacking the Academy" using N+7, which replaces each noun with the dictionary word seven entries later.

Key insight from Sample: N+7 "celebrates the random, valorizing the lack of what artists, writers, and intellectuals often seek: control. It is pure engagement with the outside world."

Sample result: "Every fact is a fad and print is a prison. Instructors are insurgents and introductions are invasions. Questions become quicksand. Universities, uprisings."

**Example 2: Siobhan O'Flynn's "An Experiment in Yellow"**

An interactive Twine narrative co-created with ChatGPT4, DALL-E, and Midjourney, engaging with Charlotte Perkins Gilman's "The Yellow Wallpaper" (1891).

O'Flynn fed lines from the story into LLMs and let hallucinations break down legibility. The result amplifies the source text's hallucinations, uncannily rendering the protagonist's subjective state even more explicitly.

O'Flynn writes: "The intention is to explore the convergence of these combined platforms to represent and simulate the dynamics of confinement and escape... These experiments with LLMs in fractured dialogue offer a further opportunity to critique the limitations and biases already well-documented in 'AI in the wild.'"

### Creating Your Own Deformances

**Step 1: Select Your Source Text**

Choose poetic or prose language that resonates with you. Consider texts that:
- Have strong imagery or emotion
- Deal with themes of power, control, or transformation
- Can withstand radical reinterpretation

**Step 2: Choose Your Deformation Method**

Decide how you'll deform the text:
- Feed into text generators for textual deformation
- Use text-to-image AI to visualize fragments
- Generate sound/music from poetic prompts
- Combine multiple modalities

**Step 3: Resist Standard Aesthetics**

Actively fight against:
- Hyperrealism
- Smoothness
- Typical commercial AI aesthetics

Embrace:
- Surrealism
- Expressionism
- Uncanny modes
- Glitches and hallucinations
- Unexpected juxtapositions

**Step 4: Iterate and Experiment**

Run multiple experiments. You cannot predict results—that's the point.

Ask yourself:
- What is this deformation making visible?
- What cultural logic is being exposed?
- What biases appear in the output?
- How does this differ from what I expected?

**Step 5: Frame Your Results**

Consider how to present your deformances:
- In relation to the source text?
- As standalone works?
- With critical commentary?
- As evidence of AI's limitations and biases?

## Notes

### Art Must "Keep a Strange, Estrange on It"
— Gertrude Stein, *Tender Buttons* (1913)

### Understanding Deformance

Jerome McGann and Lisa Samuels (1999): "When we run the deformative program through a particular work we cannot predict the results... and we are brought to a critical position in which we can imagine things about the text that we did not and perhaps could not otherwise know."

### Difficulty Rating Note

Rating: 🍳 (one pan, easy)

Note: "Multiple servings, not all are expected to be delicious or even edible"

The ease comes from using AI tools; the difficulty lies in critical engagement and resisting their affordances.
