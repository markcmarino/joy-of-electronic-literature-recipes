abstract: Create animated kinetic poetry using Microsoft PowerPoint's Morph and Animation features for mixed media verse.
description: >
  For writers and poets who want to experiment with mixed media poetry but have limited technology skills, or for technologists unfamiliar with kinetic concept art poetry, Microsoft PowerPoint offers an easy way to explore new possibilities. Although artists like David Byrne and poet Brent Ameneyro have demonstrated PowerPoint's poetic potential, its use as an artistic platform remains uncommon—perhaps due to resistance against breaking the business-corporate paradigm of Microsoft tools, or because defunct Adobe Flash set impossible standards. This recipe invites you to have fun creating post-modernist concept or concrete poetry on an electronic screen. The approach uses PowerPoint's Morph function to create smooth transitions between slides, animation effects to make letters and words move kinetically, and combinations of text, images, sound, and visual effects. The primordial requirement remains unchanged from traditional poetry: using aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language and visual elements to evoke meanings, emotions, thoughts, and ideas in creative, often figurative ways. The cyborg approach treats technology as partner, following an inductive process that starts small, emphasizes discovery, and leaves work open to dilemma and self-questioning.

## Ingredients

### For "Swept Skin Slid" Example:
- Word bank (start with SKIN, SWIM, SLIP... build as you go)
- Object/image slide bank (start with nude bodies, water... build as you go)
- Microsoft PowerPoint
- Motion & animation effects (text fly-ins, word morphs, image morphs)

### For "Thrum Heart Effects" Example:
- Lyric or meaningful 3-to-5-word strings
- Multilingual phrases (e.g., "Mon pauvre cœur a peur" - French, "Pulso pulgar palpita" - Spanish)
- Single words (meurt, fractuals, effects)
- Object/image bank with PowerPoint Designer variations
- Sound files (jazz pieces with improvisation and rhythmic beats work well)

## Method

### Recipe 1: "Swept Skin Slid" - Using Morph for Flow

This recipe emphasizes the Morph function to create flowing transitions between images and text.

**Preparation time:** 3-4 hours
**Note:** Time and difficulty depend on familiarity with advanced PowerPoint features.

**Step 1: Create Duplicate Slides with Beginning Water Image**

- Open a blank PowerPoint presentation
- Click Insert tab → New slide → Blank
- Click Insert → Pictures → select desired photos from your computer
- Highlight the slide, right-click, and select Duplicate slide twice (creating three identical slides)

**Step 2: Blur the Duplicate Images Progressively**

- On the second slide, click/highlight the image
- Go to Picture Format tab → Artistic Effects → choose a lighter background
- Repeat for the third slide with an even blurrier effect

**Step 3: Create Illusion of Movement Using Morph**

- With the slide you're transitioning from selected, go to Transitions
- Click Morph and ensure you have Object effect options
- Preview by selecting Preview option in left-hand corner

**Step 4: Introduce Text Boxes**

- On the third slide (lightest background), bring in a text box with small font size (18 pt.)
- Make a duplicate slide, eliminate the background image
- Duplicate again and enlarge font size (60 pt), keeping same position

**Step 5: Create Additional Text Boxes with Related Words**

Use semantically or phonetically related words (e.g., "slip"/"spill"/"Sweeping"/"in her sleep"):
- Insert new blank slide for each new word
- Make duplicate slide
- In duplicate, key in changes (text size, color, related phrase, location)
- Go back to first text and add Morph function
- Go to Effects Options → choose "Characters" on second line
- Preview as you go

**Step 6: Transform Images**

Continue using Morph to transform images and pictures—the visual effect may be even more striking than with words:
- Bring in image from object bank
- Duplicate each slide
- Make changes to duplicate slide as you did with text boxes

**Step 7: Set Up Automatic Playback**

- Use Slide Presentation tab to view progress
- Set up slide show to run like a video:
  - Go to far-right side of Transitions bar
  - Select time for each slide (about 2 seconds)
  - Ensure all slides run "After" a time you want
  - Select "Apply To All"

**Step 8: Create Coherence**

Work on entire array of slides to create coherence or unity as you would when drafting a poem (or visual story) with all your newly created elements.

**Step 9: Add Sound Elements**

- Use Media feature (speaker icon)
- Find audio you love and add it
- Play using Slide Show tab to see how selection works with visual composition
- Jazz pieces with improvisation and rhythmic beats are often well-suited
- Choose Audio in far-right option on Media bar
- Choose piece from your computer

### Recipe 2: "Thrum Heart Effects" - Using Animations for Kinetic Text

This recipe emphasizes the Animations tab to produce kinetic, concrete, typographic pieces—letters that move, create shapes, and are themselves repurposed forms.

**Preparation time:** 4.5 hours
**Note:** Some familiarity with PowerPoint Advanced Motions desirable. Exploring Advanced Animations and Animation Pane options will be a plus.

**Step 1: Create Image Variations**

- Insert picture on blank slide by searching "heart" (from stock pictures or device)
- Open Picture Format Picture tab
- Click Remove Background to make heart image stand alone
- Add text box with word strings like "Refracted heartfelt facts"

**Step 2: Modify Images**

- Duplicate first slide several times
- Modify each successive picture using Picture Format → Artistic effects
- Apply Morph function to new slides
- Eliminate, enhance, or cut text box

**Step 3: Produce Kinetic Word/Letter Effects**

Using Animations tab:
- Select first text box and click Appear
- Open Animation Pane
- Open Picture 1 there to apply Effect Options
- Choose "by letter"
- Use Preview to see each character appear successively

**Step 4: Create Concentrated Lettrist Effects**

As Kenneth Goldsmith suggests in *The New Concrete*: "Letters would double as carriers of semantic content and as powerful visual elements in their own right."

- Make text box for each letter of a word
- Animate each letter with Appear animation option
- Click each picture on Animation Pane
- Set to "After Previous"

**Step 5: Use Morph Between Slides**

- Insert Morph function between slides where you want to move image or word
- Interesting options: resizing image with rhythm, selecting sound effect option from Animation pane
- Timing should generally be Fast or Medium

**Step 6: Review Progress**

Use Slide Show presentation option for reviewing part series or entire slide show poem.

## Notes

### Approach to Digital Poetry in PowerPoint

Consider these points when creating:

- **Cyborg approach**: Technology as partner; PowerPoint offers designer suggestions and Copilot interface
- **Inductive process**: Start small, focus on moment, emphasize discovery
- **Play, ask & explore**: Leave discourse open to dilemma, controversy, self-questioning
- **21st century deconstructivist**: Break up language & meaning
- **Avoid rant or commentary**: Unless done deliberately as voice of consciousness in "Greek chorus" style
- **Context is everything**: Real developers of PowerPoint language features with their perspectives were behind the tool
- **Leave sketches exposed**: Roughness, difficulty, incompleteness (to contrast with commercial consumer entertainment) are welcome

### Design Ideas

Derive design and text ideas from:
- Concrete and kinetic poetry practices
- Lettrist/typographic variations (e.g., e.e. cummings)
- Contemporary codework like Mezangelle (@MezBreezeDesign)

### Leitmotiv for Digital Poetry

**Venture to improvise!**
