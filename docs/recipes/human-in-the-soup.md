title: Human in the Soup
chef: Andrew Klobucar
abstract: Six electronically generated poems using PoemChef, exploring generative
  writing systems while keeping the human element central to the creative process.
description: |
  Human in the Soup is a ready-to-read performance of six electronically generated
  poems — a "discourse plate" — produced using PoemChef, a poetry generator app
  that allows writers to produce poems in select genres by choosing themes and
  formats from an interactive writing tool.

  The piece takes its title from the central question of our GenAI era: where is
  the human in the soup? The recipes demonstrate that generative systems and
  interactive media can serve as a working answer — not by replacing human
  creativity, but by acting as a cybernetic writing partner. The poem chef still
  maintains the choice of completing any number of lines while allowing the tool
  to generate more if necessary.

  PoemChef provides an algorithmic buffet: an opening screen of poetry genres,
  with sub-options for themes and literary devices that apply across all genres.
  The discourse plate introduced here consists of six genre-courses designed to
  create a consistent shift in rhythm across a multi-generational audience:
  MicroPoem (amuse-bouche), DNA Poem (appetizer), Canto (first course),
  Villanelle (main course), Vorticism (palate cleanser), and Haiku (dessert).

  The most crucial point: while algorithms provide structure, the human ear and
  voice add the authentic flavor.

## Background

Every burgeoning poet at any stage in their work is looking for something
sustainable in the latest literary stream. The "Cybertext" of the late 1990s
seems today increasingly capable of operating without human intervention. The
discourse plate introduced here suggests that generative systems might be a
working answer: not by pushing out the human, but by making collaboration the
form itself.

## Ingredients

- WiFi
- A laptop
- The free app [PoemChef](https://poemchef.andrewklobucar.com/)

**Preparation time:** 5 minutes per course for a 30-minute discourse plate

## The Discourse Plate: Six Courses

Opening the app provides an easy way to produce different genres of poetry.
Clicking any genre opens your workspace — the poetry kitchen. For each course,
choose your ingredients (themes) and at least two literary devices, then
generate and complete lines as the poem chef.

### Amuse-Bouche: MicroPoem

A single, perfect drop of concentrated essence — three lines that burst with
meaning on first contact. Contains entire worlds compressed into one delicate form.
Pairs exquisitely with a voice barely above silence.

- **Difficulty:** 🍳
- **Cook time:** 8 minutes
- **Theme:** Consciousness
- **Literary Devices:** Consonance, Juxtaposition
- **Structure:** 2–4 lines, highly condensed meaning

---

### Appetizer: DNA Poem

Verse structured in spiraling double helices, where meaning winds around itself
in complementary strands. Best performed with two-voice pairings parallel to the
intertwining words.

- **Difficulty:** 🍳
- **Theme:** Digital Identity
- **Literary Devices:** Anaphora, Superposition

---

### First Course: Canto

A vintage technique aged to perfection — complex notes that slowly reveal
themselves. Best served with a voice that subtly emphasizes architectural letters,
creating a secret scaffold of sound.

- **Difficulty:** 🍳🍳🍳🍳
- **Cook time:** 40 minutes
- **Theme:** Digital Identity
- **Literary Devices:** Anaphora, Superposition
- **Structure:** Free-flowing with multiple literary techniques and historical references

---

### Main Course: Villanelle

The savory highlight — a 19-line form with 5 tercets and a quatrain using the
A1bA2, abA1, abA2 pattern. Words arranged as a powerful architectural form on
the page. Best performed with a voice that traces the visual journey, rising and
falling with the poem's landscape.

- **Difficulty:** 🍳🍳🍳
- **Cook time:** 45 minutes
- **Theme:** Resilience
- **Literary Devices:** Personification, Logopoeia

---

### Pre-Dessert Palate Cleanser: Vortex Poem

A small, light poem to neutralize the taste buds and prepare the mind for the
next poetic experience — wherever, whenever, however it comes.

- **Theme:** Digital Minimalism
- **Literary Devices:** Metaphor, Imagery
- **Structure:** 9 lines arranged in a spiraling vortex form

---

### Dessert: Haiku

The simplest of finales — deceptively simple, completing strong readings with
an elegant ending. PoemChef features this genre directly.

## Notes

The aim of becoming a skilled Poem Chef is to maintain control over your
creations, as future generative systems will continue to challenge us to keep
the human element somewhere in the process. While interacting with the software,
the poem chef maintains the choice of completing any number of lines while
allowing the tool to generate more if necessary. The finished work remains
cybernetic — a new generative system as writing partner.
