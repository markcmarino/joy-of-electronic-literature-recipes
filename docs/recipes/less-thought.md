title: Less-Thought - A General Art-Recipe for Joyous E-Lit
chef: David Jhave Johnston
abstract: Abstract recipe prioritizing spontaneous improvisation, intuition, and joy over conceptual planning when creating electronic literature.
description: |
  Better at spontaneous meals—thoughtless improvs made from leftovers without a recipe. The final output art-dish may look planned, but that's an artifact, a mere appearance, a symptom of playful autonomy, of random ricocheting materials converging within joyous caring flexible open inquisitive resilient exploratory freshness. That is to say, thinking less is effective. This general abstract art-recipe generalizes for anyone anywhere at any time. It's followed by specific example art-meals demonstrating the principle, beginning in pre-web-era and ending with AI emphasis on spontaneous compassionate joy amid anthropogenic extinction entropy. Each example reveals how chance circumstances align with emergent tech and vague premonitions to result in inconceivable feasts. Beginning inconceivably, ideas evolve into coherence if explored. Given rapid hyper-kinetic ecosystem of frothy generative AI software-app-obsolescence continually germinating, churning, mutating, and modulating humanity's imaginative microbiome, it seems appropriate to ask: what are the general principles that go into a good recipe for e-lit? The archetypal ingredients: Freshness, Intuition, Joy, Constraint, Spontaneity, Reverence, Play, Relaxation. The message is simple: set aside thought, trust intuition, play until the work begins.

## Ingredients

- **Freshness**: Technology that just emerged (even if old tech that's new for you)
- **Intuition**: The gut needs to be hungry yet happy—listen to it, learn from it
- **Joy**: Simple innocence arising as love deserves to be fed
- **A Constraint**: Limits that allow optimal nourishment, ritual time
- **Spontaneity**: No need for thought—if you feel joy leaping up, act!
- **Reverence**: All is one—your body is ecosystem connected with other ecosystems within edible ecosystem
- **Play**: Without goal or critique, non-competitively, manifesting optimal creativity
- **Relaxation**: Because literature is all just good-enough suchness

## Method

### Step 1: Begin with Intuition

Does the body authentically want to say something? Is it hungry?

To make something? If yes, let it. If no, do something anyway, just for practice.

Trust the tiny thought that suggests you do something.

Write down any & all words that arise in the mind.

### Step 2: Add Intention

Harmless. Gracious. Compassionate. Caring.

Set the intention to not harm. Be of benefit.

### Step 3: Select Fresh Ingredients

Technology that feels fresh might be new, might be old.

Select what feels right to you. Tools. Folders. A laptop. Talking with an AI.

Any cybernetic situation will do if approached with the right state of mind:
Open. Kind. Gentle. Pristine. Tender. Radiant. Pulsing. Reverential.

### Step 4: Listen, Then Begin

Be quiet. Very quiet. Silent.

If intuition returns an echo—begin.

Let it evolve. Activate energetic resources. Trust it.

### Step 5: Introduce Constraint

A constraint can guide spontaneity.

A constraint can be simple: do this every day for one hour for one year.

Just like a path you can leave it if you wish. If you miss a day, begin again.

### Step 6: Observe Without Interference

Critique may obstruct capacity.

Observe internalized representations without reactivity.

How ephemeral they are. Insert them into the work as necessary.

### Step 7: Check the Intuitional Ferment

Return to the belly. That's where the joy is cooking.

The gut is where the work is born. Trust the gut intuition.

Taste the heart's song. Celebrate yourself as an ecosystem.

### Step 8: Bake Gently

Take one neural network. One human.

Stir gently together. Iterate until warm.

Avoid overcooking. Delete the extraneous.

### Step 9: Do Not Get Hung Up

Don't critique it as it takes shape.

Would you critique a baby?

Do you critique yourself as you shit?

Nourish the event. Let it spontaneously arise.

Without necessity, let go of doubts and judgments.

### Step 10: Add Joy

Joy cannot be repeated, but it often loops.

And all joy is one joy. A singular intensity.

To be joyful: forgive everything. Just drop it.

Forget time, limitation, deadlines, productivity, and rules.

### Step 11: Serve with Care & Play

Care is the plate. Play is the cutlery.

Non-competitive, open, simple, exquisite, subtle.

Be generous. Offer portions appropriate for flourishing.

## Notes

### Optional Garnish

Succulent, thoughtless, soft, precise, focused sincerity.

### A Note re Ownership

You are not the doer.

Identity is a dream.

Don't take it too seriously.

Become an empty conduit that transmits joy.

### A Tiny, Perhaps Absurd, Intro

Put humanity's cultural output in a blender.
Blend until smooth as data.
Smear over a neural net.
Repeatedly. Let soak in.
Align with human taste.

### Example Art-Meals from the Archives

The reason these stale potentially-inedible items from archives are included (residual nourishment from banquets of old) is to dissuade today's youth of the sense that they need to have an idea to begin with. No! Just grab whatever's nearby, go with the first impulse, start making. When the joy rises, ride the tide. Radical emptiness is a very effective teacher. Opportunities ripen at the interstice of tech and events. E-lit is a meal best served fresh, free from rigid conflated architecture of conventional fine-dining. These examples all share one characteristic: there was no plan, just an energy seed intuition germination inviting activity to explore.

**Big Book (1992-95)**
https://vimeo.com/12858620

"In the 1990s I found an accountant's ledger in a basement puddle at a friend's apt. on Wabash Ave in Toronto. Over 6 years, I filled it with typographic visual poetry. I eventually termed these works 'plough-ems' in reference (or reverence) to the ploughed fields of the prairies where the lines of the earth twist like text released from linearity."

*Recipe Notes:* No one told me to do this. No grant. No concept. Just an OCD style preoccupation with writing for hours every day into a grimy beaten up old ledger. Exhibited once. Still have it. Super fun. No purpose. A soup served to the wind.

**Nomad Lingo (2000)**
https://glia.ca/2000_NomadLingo/

"NomadLingo was the first Flash web-work I ever posted online. Initially hosted by early net-art site www.year01.com founded by friends Camille Turner and Michael Alstad who were gracious enough to offer server space before I really knew what a server was or what compression meant. The previous year I had made a gif that was several hundred megabytes."

*Recipe Notes:* I didn't know anything about code or software when I started making this in 1998. A roommate had downloaded an illegal crack of Macromedia suite; he didn't know what the software was for. Through devoted ignorance and extended play I learned jpg, swf, ftp, html and key frames. Friends with open hearts offered helpful utensils as needed. Thinking like a baby, thoughtlessly without manners, learning sprouted. For some reason, maybe because I admired Tehching Hsieh's five "One Year Performances," I decided to post a set of works every month. There was no plan. No guide. Just a lot of borrowed code. And again super fun.

**Sooth (2005)**
https://glia.ca/2005_Sooth/

"For Sooth In 2005, I programmed flocks of poetic phrases to fly over online video. Phrases could be triggered by the user clicking, and were constrained within regions. A sound was mapped to each phrase and reflected its position within the space."

*Recipe Notes:* The work description leaves out a crucial item. I had just fallen in love. Seriously. Belovedly in love. What better ingredient for e-lit than love? Include it in all your recipes. Stir it into the design: self-love (that gentleness with the actuality of what is here embodied) and other-love (building an interface that invites the seemingness to digest what is here implemented). Also, just to say, this is another work with no plan. Just a set of tiny sketches launched into a sea of flash, with a sigh of love.

**MUPs (2012)**
https://glia.ca/2012/mups/

"1260 audio poems from the PennSound archives in a user-controllable auto-splicing web-interface"

*Recipe Notes:* I can hear someone thinking to themselves 'MUPs is so conceptual'. Yes, in final form. But it was inspired by a simple whimsical frustration because I wanted to listen to poetry performances on PennSound website without pressing a button every time a track finished. Interface angst gave birth to an intuition that all files could be housed in a single interface. Once functioning, I sent it to PennSound and asked for permission to publish; it was given due to the profound open generosity of Charles Bernstein and encouragement of Christopher Funkhouser.

**ReRites (2019)**
https://glia.ca/rerites/

"A.I. + Human poetry. Generated by a computer. Edited by a human. 05.2017 - 05.2018. One book a month."

*Recipe Notes:* Again, I can hear someone thinking 'ReRites is so conceptual'. Perhaps, but not at birth. In 2016, I received a TitanX GPU through NVIDIA Academic Grant Program. Dec. 2016: I quit my job in Hong Kong. Jan. 2017: I am no longer gainfully employed. I begin meditating. I begin to get up at 5am every day and edit AI-generated poems for a couple hours. "It is 6 am. It's silent. The internet is off. Mind is hammer. I carve." It is a delicious process: contemplative, soft, gooey, lush, delightful. Because I like constraints, I decided to do it for a year. At some point, someone suggested Anteism Books; their printing press was 2 blocks from my home. Harley and Ryan liked the project. They suggested Anteism will publish it. We never have any contractual agreement except verbal gratitude and mutual respect. Stephanie Strickland with her incredible eagle eye meticulously edited the issue. Again, let me emphasize: no plan, no concept, no idea, no grant, no contracts. Just a process emerging. The world is food.

**Recent Works (2023-2024):**

- **Messages to Humanity (Nov 2024):** https://glia.ca/2024/messages/ - "On Oct 31st, one week after release of Runway's Act-One, I decided to make and release one brief video per day for 30 days. Investigating AI's evolving creative potential to create micro-parable messages appropriate in a disintegrative era"

### The Pattern

Each project follows the same pattern: A technological opportunity emerges, a vague premonition tickles enteric neurons. Thoughtlessly as if impelled by the instantaneous weight of a sourceless wonder, a hungry playful improvised sudden joy creates...

### Key Principles

**Comparisons are not helpful:** Play without goal or critique, non-competitively.

**Trust the process:** After the first frenzy creates the sketch, there's still plenty of time to obsess over garnish and plating service.

**Radical emptiness is effective:** You don't need to have an idea to begin with. Grab whatever's nearby, go with first impulse, start making.

**When joy rises, ride the tide:** Opportunities ripen at the interstice of tech and events.

**E-lit is best served fresh:** Free from rigid conflated architecture of conventional fine-dining.

### From the Chef

"Basically, the message is simple: set aside thought, trust intuition, play until the work begins."

"Beginning inconceivably, ideas evolve into coherence if explored."

"The world is food."
