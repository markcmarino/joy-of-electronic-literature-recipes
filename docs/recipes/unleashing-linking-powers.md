title: Unleashing Your Linking Powers
chef: Deena Larsen
abstract: An exploration of the meanings links carry in hypertext, with three
  recipes for creating poster-based and electronic linked narratives.
description: |
  Unleashing Your Linking Powers is a set of three recipes for understanding and
  building hypertext through the power of its links. Links are more than conduits
  between nodes — they create meaning themselves. Where the author puts a link
  swells in importance as the anchor point carries an action; where the link goes
  is colored by what has come before.

  The recipe introduces eight types of semantic links — denotative, connotative,
  echo, opposing, descriptive, expansive, plot-based, and evocative — using a
  sample poster hypertext about a character named Maya to demonstrate each type.
  From there, three progressive recipes build linking fluency: first with a solo
  paper poster using physical materials; then with a group poster exercise for
  classrooms or conferences; and finally with electronic hypertexts built in
  Twine, StorySpace, HTML, or any linking tool.

  The exercises work with any age group, any ability level, and practically any
  materials. They have been used with children with developmental disabilities,
  undergraduate writers at Brown University, and conference participants. Links,
  like spices, do not themselves make up the entire dish — you need content, and
  the more related the content, the stronger the links.

  emotional, and narrative meaning, built through poster exercises that develop
  linking intuition transferable to digital tools like Twine.

## Background

The power of hypertext lurks within its links. We click on links all the time
without really looking at what they are and what they are capable of. Yet links
can knit yarns together and create relationships within the knots of content nodes
formed from texts, images, and sound. More than just conduits, links create
meaning themselves.

## Link Types

Links can carry many different meanings — it is the ultimate ingredient in any
hypertext: a spice that can give practically any flavor.

| Type | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Denote** | Define, clarify, or provide supplemental information |
| **Connote** | Imply other meanings and contexts; continue a story |
| **Echo** | Emphasize or carry on a theme through repetition |
| **Oppose** | Challenge with a contrapuntal or contradicting voice |
| **Describe** | Imbue text or image with further meaning and detail |
| **Expand** | Provide more context and information |
| **Plot** | Give readers a sense of what happened, when, and to whom |
| **Evoke** | Appeal to the readers' emotions |

## Recipe 1: Solo Paper Poster

**Class of E-lit:** Hypertext node and link
**Dish:** A simple way to kickstart your own hypertext writing
**Ingredients:** A background surface (posterboard, floor, wall), nodes (paper, cards, objects), links (string, ribbon, drawn lines), and something to attach them (tape, glue)
**Preparation time:** 15 minutes to years
**Rating:** 🍳 one pan, easy

**Directions:**
1. Create fewer than 10 nodes. Write, draw, cook, or find whatever your heart desires. What do you want to say to the world? Pull out an old draft of writing that did not work — will those passages work if separated and linked in various ways?
2. Arrange nodes in your space. Think about structure — should they form the shape of a flower? A diamond? What structure fits your content?
3. Link nodes together with connections that add meanings: What explains what? What plays up dissonances? What could cause a reader to cry or smile? What words or ideas echo each other?
4. Use different link materials to represent different relationships.
5. When you have your piece, present it. Use it as a basis for work in Twine.

## Recipe 2: Group Poster

**Class of E-lit:** Hypertext node and link
**Dish:** A simple starter to gain relationship-building skills
**Ingredients:** 4–6 participants, a background surface, a main node prepared in advance, blank nodes (one per participant), moveable links (ribbon or string), tape
**Preparation time:** 30 minutes + 10 minutes per group for readings
**Rating:** 🍳 one pan, easy

**Directions:**
1. Choose a main node beforehand (an image or poem is evocative).
2. Ask each person to write for 5 minutes on the main node.
3. Exchange your nodes so everyone has someone else's writing.
4. Put the original main node in the center. Arrange all nodes on the board — discuss where they go spatially, what has a relationship to what.
5. Discuss the connections between nodes and use threads to symbolize relationships. Create a legend (e.g., red ribbons = love, blue = truth, green = lies).
6. Build a story using these connections. Add or subtract content as needed.

## Recipe 3: Electronic Hypertexts

**Class of E-lit:** Hypertext node and link
**Dish:** Electronic works
**Ingredients:** Any electronic program that allows linking (StorySpace, Twine, HTML, PowerPoint, Unity)
**Preparation time:** 10 minutes to a lifetime
**Rating:** 🍳 one pan, easy

**Directions:**
1. Write for 5 minutes about something — an event, a puzzle, an emotional time. Now you have a main node.
2. Highlight 4 words. Create new nodes titled with those words. Link from the main node to them using those words as anchors.
3. For each of the 4 new nodes, expand content — find an image, write an expansion, a commentary, a clarification.
4. Think about the relationships in your 5 nodes. Add links between them.
5. Add or subtract nodes. Keep on linking between old and new.
6. Think about accessibility — can links be noticed and followed with a screenreader?
7. Try arranging nodes in different ways. How does new structure inject new meaning?

## Notes

I have been fascinated by links for decades. Creating several small poster hypertexts will help you develop the linking skills to create a larger hypertext with meaningful stitching. Go. Have fun. Unleash your works upon the world.
