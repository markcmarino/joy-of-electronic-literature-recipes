title: Distant Feeling(s)
chef: Annie Abrahams
abstract: A silent telematic ritual in which participants close their eyes over
  videoconference for fifteen minutes, exploring presence and togetherness across distance.
description: >
  Distant Feeling(s) is a telematic performance and recurring ritual co-founded
  by Annie Abrahams and Daniel Pinheiro in 2015, growing from an earlier work
  called Placelessness by Daniel Pinheiro, Lisa Parra, and others. Participants
  gather via videoconference, then close their eyes for fifteen minutes of shared
  silence, cameras and microphones left on.

  Without the ability to see one another, the shared sound environment — each
  participant's home noise mixing with others, all altered by the compression
  algorithms of the videoconferencing tool — becomes the common space. The webcam
  witnesses rather than performs. The session is recorded and made available to
  participants afterward.

  The piece operates against the dominant modes of digital interaction:
  productivity, immediacy, and surveillance. It trains what the artists call being
  together "with" — a meditative practice of co-presence that counters online
  restlessness and alienation.

  From Distant Feeling(s) grew two related practices: Utterings, which adds
  vocalization while blindfolded; and Distant Movements, which introduces guided
  embodied dance in front of a screen with eyes closed. Together they form a
  practice of attentive online presence.

  Co-founder Daniel Pinheiro died unexpectedly in January 2025, shortly after
  the project's eighth annual reconnection.

## Background

Our bodies are often absent and get very little attention in our electronic life
and our interactions with machines. Our online relations evolve through clicking,
thumbing, and chatting. Our hands and brains are in use, while the rest of our
body gets ignored. While connected to an overload of friends and information, we
become restless and even lonely.

This recipe helps to counter electronic restlessness, to connect over distance,
to create consciousness of kinship, and to bridge differences. It trains us how
to be together "with."

## From the Chef

In 2015 Daniel Pinheiro, a researcher/performer in telematic art from Porto, and
Lisa Parra, a choreographer from New York, asked me to participate in their online
piece called Placelessness. We sat silently with closed eyes in front of our
computers trying to experience the others' presence across the network. It was an
extraordinary experience that in the years to come became a yearly ritual
celebrating online togetherness, while meditating on our entanglement with the
machines and what that meant to us.

## Ingredients

- Interested participants (4–6 recommended)
- Computer or phone with videoconferencing tool installed
- Quiet environment / solitude
- Internet connection
- A timer with an alarm

**Preparation time:** 20 minutes

## Method

1. Send out an invitation for interested people to participate in a shared moment
   of togetherness across distance.
2. At the set time, open a videoconferencing meeting where all participants can
   see each other.
3. After a simple welcome, ask participants to keep video and sound on while they
   close their eyes and engage in a 15-minute silent encounter. The sounds of
   each participant's environment will create the common space.
4. Set an alarm so everyone is warned of the end and can open their eyes to look
   at each other before saying goodbye.
5. There is no spoken evaluation.

## Variations

**Utterings** — In Utterings, participants wear a blindfold and use their voice
to make sounds, building solos, duos, chorales, and silence. Not singing or music:
communication beyond language. See: [utterings.hotglue.me](https://utterings.hotglue.me)

Tips for Utterings:
- Keep groups to 4–6 people
- Begin with a shared sound piece to attune everyone to the same register
- Use only your voice, nothing else
- Silence is beautiful

**Distant Movements** — An experience of dance in front of a screen, guided by
voice, with eyes closed. The organizer announces a theme (one word: breathing,
wind, an animal, a recent event) and gives gentle movement incentives throughout.
Participants start by balancing with eyes open, then close them while continuing.

## Notes

None of this would have been without Daniel Pinheiro, with whom I co-founded
these projects and who became over time a very dear friend. We shared a profound
interest in the place of the body (and affect) in the digital. Daniel was
inspiring, generous, delicate, and delicious. He is sorely missed.
