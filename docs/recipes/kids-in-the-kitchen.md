  Kids in the Kitchen introduces the YCO2 Story Prompter, a Twine-built tool
  that generates a starter passage for interactive digital narratives (IDN),
  helping new narrative designers bridge the gap between consumer and creator.

  The prompter emerged from classroom experience with the You and CO2 project,
  a climate change education initiative. Teachers discovered that students
  needed more scaffolding before they could begin writing in Twine — not a box
  mix, but a starter dough they could take, develop, and bake themselves.

  Two recipe versions address different starting points. Version 1 builds from
  a story idea developed through an exercise in the YCO2 Teacher's Pack, walking
  students through storyworld, characters, narrative perspective, and opening
  events before generating a Twine passage to copy and paste. Version 2 starts
  from scratch, asking students what they love and how it connects to climate
  impact, generating branching passages where each branch represents an
  environmental effect for the student to research and address.

  Because the prompter is itself built in Twine using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
  it serves as a model recipe for starter-dough Twines on any topic — import the
  .html file into a Twine library and change the subject.

## Background

Every burgeoning baker discovers at some point that baking is both chemistry
and artistry. The bridge between box-cake consumer and cake designer — between
a player/reader and interactive narrative designer — covers a vast unknown expanse
filled with creative challenges. What story do you want to tell? What mechanics
can carry it? Where do you even start?

The Story Prompter helps new bakers forage and gather ingredients, then puts
them together into a starter dough: the first few lines of a story and several
branching passages, ready to drop into a new Twine work as a base.

## Sample Before You Cook

- [YCO2 Story Prompter](https://youandco2.org/prompt/)
- [YCO2 Teacher's Pack](https://youandco2.org/teachers-pack/)
- Discussion of You and CO2 in the Tastings section of this book

## Ingredients

- Twine (free at [twinery.org](https://www.twinery.org))
- A web browser
- A story idea (or willingness to generate one)

**Time:** Variable (prompter itself: 10–15 minutes; developing the story: much longer)

## Recipe Version 1: Building from a Story Idea

For students who have worked through the YCO2 exercise, or who already have a
story idea in mind.

**Directions:**
1. Open the [YCO2 Story Prompter](https://youandco2.org/prompt/).
2. If you've done the Teacher's Pack exercise, select "I have a story idea."
3. Follow the prompts to establish:
   - **Storyworld** — as simple as "Wales" or as fantastic as "a fairy's mushroom"
   - **Narrative perspective** — first or second person
   - **Characters** — yourself or someone else; names and pronouns for player-character and up to two additional characters
   - **Time setting** — past, present, or future
   - **Opening events** — the first couple of actions in the story, with branching options
4. Review the summary and confirm when ready.
5. Open Twine, create a new story, and paste the generated text into your first passage. The generated text includes links to your first branching passages.
6. From here, research, develop, and bake.

## Recipe Version 2: Starting from Scratch

For classrooms without time between workshops, or students who want a different
idea.

**Directions:**
1. Open the Story Prompter and select "Start from scratch."
2. Answer questions about what you love: hobbies, activities, interests.
3. Select narrative perspective.
4. Check boxes for how your favourite thing interacts with the environment: travel, resource mining, electricity, shipping, food, and more.
5. The prompter generates a starter passage with links for each environmental effect — each linking to a new passage where you must figure out, through research and creative thinking, how to reduce that impact.
6. Paste into Twine and develop.

## Notes

The Story Prompter does pretty much what it says on the tin: it prompts the story
rather than generating it. The new narrative designer still has to engage various
learning methods, writing skills, and digital development pathways. This is a
starter dough — not a finished loaf.

Because the prompter is built entirely in Twine (using in-text HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript), it is available as a model for starter-dough Twines on other projects
and topics. Save the `.html` file, import it into a Twine library, and adapt it
to your own subject by changing the topic and prompter questions.
