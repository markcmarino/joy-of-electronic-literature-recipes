title: À la recherche du lieu perdu
chef: Chris Klimas
abstract: A Twine recipe for recreating a place from memory as an explorable hypertext space, without plot or character decisions—just space.
description: |
  "À la recherche du lieu perdu" is a recipe from Chris Klimas, creator of Twine, for
  building a setting inside Twine rather than a branching narrative. There are no plot
  decisions, no characters in the foreground—just the exploration of a place that can
  no longer be visited.

  The recipe begins by asking the writer to choose a meaningful but inaccessible place:
  a closed restaurant, a childhood home, a beach halfway across the world. From memory
  alone—resisting the temptation to look anything up—the writer draws a map and marks
  tour-stop points connected by paths. Each stop becomes a Twine passage, arranged on
  screen to mirror the hand-drawn map.

  The directions proceed in careful layers: first establishing spatial connections
  with bare links, then adding visual descriptions anchored to a specific time, then
  layering in a second sense (sound, smell, touch, taste), and finally drilling down
  into closeable details—under a bed, inside a locker, a page of a book—with links
  that let visitors look closer before returning to the main location.

  Klimas offers optional extensions for the writer who wants to go further: making time
  pass subtly through code, hiding something personally meaningful in an unobvious
  location, adding a background person who cannot be spoken to. The piece is shared
  as a single HTML file via Twine's Publish to File feature—no server required.

  A Twine story that recreates a remembered place as a linked map of passages, inviting
  visitors to wander, examine details, and experience memory as an explorable, sensory
  hypertext space.

## Ingredients

- [Twine](https://www.twinery.org) (free, download or use online)
- A place you can no longer visit (changed or disappeared)
- Pen and paper for mapping
- Memories—no looking things up

## Method

**Preparation**

1. Choose a place that holds meaning but that you can no longer visit: a closed restaurant, childhood home, a faraway beach. It should be a place you remember fondly and that has changed or disappeared.
2. Draw a map from memory. It doesn't need to be to scale or accurate—it should reflect how you *remember* the place. Add as many things to see and do as you can.
3. Plan a tour: draw a star at each stop you'd make. Connect the stars with continuous paths (every star should be reachable from every other). Add stars where paths intersect.
4. Give each star a short, evocative name: "Cluttered Living Room," "Ankle-Deep in the Water."

**In Twine**

1. Open a new story in Twine. Add a passage for each star on your map, arranging them on screen to mirror your hand-drawn map.
2. Edit each passage and add two-way links between connected passages using `[[double brackets]]`. Don't add any other text yet—just reproduce all the map connections.
3. Choose a specific time for your place to exist (a date, or a general season). In each passage, write a paragraph describing what this place looks and feels like to someone who has never been there. No narrative commentary, no characters in the foreground, no more links yet—just neutral, detailed description.
4. Once satisfied with visual descriptions, loop back and add at least one more sense to each passage: sound, smell, touch, or taste. Also revise the bare links into fluent prose—e.g., mention the door to the auditorium and link from that phrase instead of a plain direction.
5. Let the piece breathe. Come back a day later (or at least an hour) with fresh eyes.
6. Walk through what you've created. Find the most interesting or prominent things in each passage. Turn those into links and add closer-detail passages for them (under the bed, inside the locker, a book's open pages). Give each detail passage a link back to its main location.

**Sharing**

Use Twine's **Publish to File** option to produce a standalone HTML file. It can be emailed, shared via cloud storage, or posted on a website—no server software required.

## Notes

- The piece is explicitly *not* a scavenger hunt. If you hide something meaningful, don't make finding it a reward—just let visitors observe it.
- If you add a person to the space, make it someone you'd find there, not yourself. You don't need to let visitors interact with them.
- Time can pass subtly (a slow afternoon light shift) or dramatically (a lever that changes winter to spring).
- Think about who you'd want to share this with—it doesn't have to be the whole world. Twine HTML files can be shared privately with just one person.
- Twine was created by Chris Klimas and first released in 2009. Available at [twinery.org](https://www.twinery.org).
