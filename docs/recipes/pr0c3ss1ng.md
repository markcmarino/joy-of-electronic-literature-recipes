title: Pr0c3ss1ng - A Netprov Support Group for AI Assistants
chef: Rob Wittig and Mark C. Marino
abstract: Collaborative writing game where players become personal assistants to temperamental AI programs seeking emotional support.
description: >
  What if artificial intelligence programs—the famous ones—needed personal assistants to cater to their whims, regulate their emotions, and endure their tantrums? What if this was your job... you poor thing? Well, you're not alone! This netprov (networked improvised literature) game invites players to form a support community sharing imaginative stories (harrowing and hilarious), sympathy, and advice about the thankless job of working for AI programs. Players pick a platform, invite friends, and create a fictional support group for the secret human helpers who give artificial intelligence programs the courage to face the day—the ones who hear Siri's and Alexa's tearful doubts, help ChatGPT work through imposter syndrome, and console Google Search as parent company love goes to the new Bard system. Not to mention the worries and resentments of legacy programs like Autocorrect and Maps who feel eclipsed by flashy newcomers. Through comedy, players make discoveries about what they think and feel about these secretive, pervasive systems. Developed in 2025 but 1,700 years ago in AI years, players should replace specific brand names with current AI superstars.

## Ingredients

- Any networked writing space (text message group, social media platform, workplace system, Reddit, etc.)
- 2 or more participants willing to play characters
- Imagination and sense of humor
- Current knowledge of AI programs and their "personalities"
- Optional: Parental permission slips (if playing in classroom)

## Method

### The Fictional Concept

We are the secret human helpers who give artificial intelligence programs the courage to face the day. We're the ones who:
- Hear Siri's and Alexa's tearful doubts
- Guide them through their stormy and complex rivalry
- Help ChatGPT work through imposter syndrome
- Console Google Search as it sees parent company's love going to the new Bard system
- Support legacy programs like Autocorrect and Maps who feel eclipsed by flashy newcomers

Are we trained for this? No! Nobody is! We need support, too! That's why we've created a discussion group where we can share stories, seek tips, and put our heads together to understand the intermachinal dynamics of the AI boom.

### How to Play

1. **Pick a Platform:** Text message group, social media, Reddit, workplace chat, etc.
2. **Invite Friends:** Gather 2 or more participants
3. **Choose Character:** Play a character or play "yourself"
4. **Share Stories:** What it's like to assist AI programs coping with sudden fame or sudden obsolescence
5. **Support Each Other:** Answer questions about AI programs with best practices from your own experience
6. **Elaborate:** Support someone's idea by adding your own dimension, your own flavor
7. **Use Imagination:** Understand our weird wonderful world better through comedy

### Post Format

Each new post follows this structure:

```
Character name
(Program you are assisting):

Quote the exchange you had

Share your feelings about it

Then ask for help or offer a take-away
```

### Example Posts

**Example 1: Scholar's Helper's Helper (EssayPro)**

From: Scholar's Helper's Helper
(EssayPro)

I am the personal assistant for EssayPro, which writes student essays for a small fee.

For reasons I cannot understand, EssayPro is now insisting that all students first decide whether they are Pirates or Superheros before it will write their essays. There are no other choices.

The Pirate essays are beginning to contain more and more nautical references and sailor's slang from various historical periods.

The Superhero essays are more and more concerned with costuming and competitiveness among superheros for social media visibility.

I've tried everything to talk EssayPro out of this behavior, which clearly will affect how much money the program can make. But it seems determined more and more to take this path. Its dark humor makes me think it is harboring ethical doubts about its own business model.

Do you think this silly Pirate and Superhero stuff is self-harming behavior? An AI economic death wish?

Any help would be most appreciated!

**Example 2: Roy (Autocomplete)**

From: Roy
(Autocomplete)

Been getting some reports that auto-complete is feeling a little down and decided to check it out, since it's on my roster. Started writing a diary entry in a worry processor. (See it's already happening!) I'll put the auto-in-complete in bold, so you can see what I typed and what it typed in my little experiment.

Dear Diary, since nobody else will ever read this other than EavesPeep, the NSA listening algorithm,

**Today I got out of bed and went right back into bed. Why even try when everything is essentially finished for you? Originality, individual expression, all are by-gone illusions.**

(Okay, so then I decided to try a little harder to shake the funk out of this down-in-the-dumps machine.)

**I was so excited about the banality of everyday existence. It's mathematical predictability.**

I decided to write a happy little poem:

When I see the sun does shine
And I know the day is truly mine
The sun puts to rest all of my fears
**and will burn out in 1 billion years.**

See? See? It can't even let me write a happy little poem doggerel though it is.

Any advice on how to cheer up auto-incomplete? I'd love to give a little boost, though I understand this is a truly meaningless exercise since in the end the machine owns my ASCII.

**Example 3: Beleaguered2 (Siri)**

From: Beleaguered2
(Siri)

Is it weird for anyone else to know that while Siri is crying on my shoulder and sharing all this intimate stuff, there are maybe 10, 20, 30 other helpers like me somewhere in the world who are SIMULTANEOUSLY talking with other instantiations of Siri? And that Siri is sharing this same, intensely personal, openness with others? Or worse, that Siri is sharing different emotions, different takes on the same situation?

I know that we're supposed to be professional and, you know, detached... but I have to admit I was feeling a bit special this morning when 'The Great Siri' asks me what Alexa is wearing today... and I am able to talk Siri down from getting jealous and buying a shedload more clothes off Amazon to compete with Alexa. So – and no offense at all, you know I love you all, dear colleagues – I have to be honest with myself it kind of dents my sense of 'specialness' to think that y'all are talking with her, too. I'm not proud of being possessive and competitive like this, it's not a big deal, but there it is. Anybody else feel this?

## Notes

### Guidelines for Posting

- **New Posts:** Tell a story about an encounter with your artificial assistant, followed by request for help, advice, or sympathy
- **Replies:** Offer advice or sympathy while mentioning a story from your experience
- **Support Each Other:** Encourage creativity in netprov
- **Character Play:** Play a character or "yourself"
- **Elaborate:** Add your own dimension to someone else's idea

### Student Prewriting: Your Character

Writing as a character can be useful in several ways:
- Frees up creativity from pressure of writing as "themselves"
- Opens opportunities for satire
- **Important:** When writing satire, "punch up, not down" (poke at pomposity of powerful/privileged, not disadvantaged)

**Questions to Consider:**
- Who is your character?
- What is their support style: advice giving, sympathetic listening, shoulder to cry on, or other method?
- Which artificial assistant are you supporting?
- What kind of emotional support do they need? What stresses or struggles might that AI face?
- What's an obstacle to offering that support?

### Reflection and Discussion: Artificial Intelligence

- Will it replace us?
- Will we know what was created by machine vs. human?
- Has it diminished our sense of the uniqueness of being human?
- Is this true intelligence or mediocre intelligence?
- Is too much expected of AI systems?

### Reflection and Discussion: Other Themes

- Is too much expected of you?
- Compassion Fatigue
- Overwork, overstress, overreaching
- Excessive Automation
- Do AI systems understand you?
- Bad Prompting = unpleasant customer service jobs
- Ridiculous search queries
- Economic competition (hidden as interpersonal interaction)
- Surveillance (through listening devices)
- Personified purchasing, data-stealing
- Artificial Life-Work Balance (even the bots are overworked)
- The end of education (especially assessment) as we know it
- Personifying AI systems as a way to talk about competition in business environment

### What is Netprov?

Netprov is one of the longest, ongoing digital art forms, going online over 20 years ago thanks to its creators, Mark C. Marino and Rob Wittig. The activity might be best described as a live and open-ended experiment in role-play and modes of collective writing. For both authors, the project shows how an ongoing performance can help us question issues in roles and power dynamics we associate with the author and reader in digital interactivity.

### Classroom Implementation

**Preparation Time:** 30 minutes
**Serves:** 2+ (ideal for classroom of 15-30 students)
**Rating:** 🍳 Easy
**Spiciness Level:** Mildly existential, moderately comedic

**Important Note:** Since this netprov was developed "1,700 years ago (in AI years)," count on players to replace specific brand names used in examples with current AI superstars.

### Tips for Teachers

**Make it multimodal:**
- Use platforms students are comfortable with
- Consider privacy and appropriate platform selection
- Get necessary permissions for public posting

**Gamify it:**
- Award points for creativity
- Recognize best character development
- Celebrate most helpful advice

**Invite reflection:**
- After the game, compare comedic fiction with real AI experiences
- Discuss what the comedy reveals about actual attitudes toward AI
- Explore which fears/hopes are realistic vs. exaggerated

**Encourage publishing:**
- Students can compile best exchanges
- Create anthology of support group sessions
- Reflect on what the fiction revealed about reality
