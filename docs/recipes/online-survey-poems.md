title: Online Survey Poems
chef: Alexandra Saum-Pascual
abstract: Repurpose corporate survey platforms like Google Forms to create interactive poetry and narrative prose.
description: >
  Not all great meals are cooked from scratch—sometimes creative seasoning transforms store-bought ingredients into something remarkable. This recipe teaches how to turn tedious online surveys into literary works that repurpose user interactivity to create new poetic or narrative experiences. By hacking familiar corporate tools like Google Forms, Survey Monkey, or Qualtrics, writers can create multiple-choice poetry that critiques the very platforms it uses. The approach treats survey elements—questions, answer options, sections, and text fields—as poetic tools, reframing data-gathering instruments as literary media. Works like Porpentine's "All Your Time-Tossed Selves" demonstrate how multiple-choice selections can determine narrative paths, while highlighting the circular nature of choice within constrained systems. This method embraces the contradictions of using corporate surveillance technology for artistic intervention, exposing hidden functionalities and the limits of user agency. The resulting works blend high and low culture, combining readymade conceptual art with accessible web platforms to demystify ubiquitous computing and digital surveillance.

## Ingredients

- Computer, tablet, or phone connected to the Internet
- Creativity
- Access to corporate survey tools: Google Forms, Survey Monkey, Qualtrics, Question Pro, or similar platforms
- Google account (for Google Forms)
- Awareness that whatever you build will be stored by the platform provider

## Method

### Understanding the Form

Survey platforms are built to connect user actions to new pages in a repetitive manner, making them ideal for hypertext-style literary works. The multiple-choice genre links interactivity with commercial or bureaucratic pursuits, adding symbolic layers to your work.

### Creating Your Survey Poem

**Step 1: Create Your Form**

Log in to your account and open a "Blank Form." You can also select from templates (customer feedback, RSVP, party invite) and modify according to your needs.

Remember: a survey poem isn't about rhyming—it's about using questions, sections, and form limitations to evoke emotion and tell poetic stories.

**Step 2: Title and Describe Your Poem**

- Give your form a title (acting as your poem's first verse)
- Use the "Form description" field as your opening stanza

**Good subjects for survey poems:**
- Memories or personal stories with alternative scenarios
- Emotions explored through multiple facets (joy, grief, dread, frustration)
- Abstract ideas like "land," "love," or "change" with multiple connotations

The goal: reframe the form from data-gathering tool to poetic medium, playing with the relationship between chef/poet and reader/dinner guest.

**Step 3: Craft Your Verses**

Understand the basic components as poetic tools:

1. **Questions**: Each question can be a verse or full stanza
2. **Answers**: Multiple choice, checkbox, or linear scale options function as verses or stanzas
3. **Text Fields**: Open-ended questions let readers become co-authors
4. **Sections**: Act as new pages or stanzas, breaking your poem into distinct parts

**Mixing question types for poetic effects:**
- Multiple-choice questions: each option is a different verse or path
- Short answer/paragraph: invite readers to write their own verses
- Linear scale: make readers reflect on a spectrum
- "Add a section" function: control flow and reveal new parts progressively

**Step 4: Break the Rules**

Challenge reader expectations by:

1. **Upsetting grammatical categories**: Split sentences between multiple options (separate subject and predicate, mix nouns and descriptions). This makes collected data useless under analytics.

2. **Playing with formatting**: Use bold, italics, underlining, and color options (via "theme" in top right corner) to emphasize specific words or phrases.

3. **Adding media**: Include header images, GIFs, and videos. Imagine creating a moving image that makes the form look like it's breaking.

4. **Pushing display capacities**: Write very long sentences exceeding regular display dimensions, forcing readers to zoom out to reveal hidden verses.

**Step 5: End Your Poem**

- Go to "Settings" to add a final "Confirmation message"
- Decide how to share (embed, link, send email)
- Choose whether to allow further responses (emphasizing recursive themes)
- Consider letting readers view the results summary, reinforcing that their reading pleasure has been recorded, become corporate data, and will feed the algorithmic systems

## Notes

### Data and Privacy Considerations

Be aware that:
- Whatever you build on Google will be stored by Google
- You retain intellectual property ownership
- Google will not own the data or use it without consent
- Google must comply with authority requests for access
- Google could use stored data for training and developing products
- Online surveying necessarily gathers data

What you do with collected responses is up to you—you may choose to do nothing.

### Variations

**Easy**: Stick to single-page poem using only multiple-choice and short-answer questions

**Medium**: Use multiple sections to create a narrative arc, experiment with images and links

**Advanced**: Incorporate conditional logic ("Go to section based on answer") to create choose-your-own-adventure poems, use extremely long verses to play with display limits, add multimedia elements like audio files for ambiance

### Examples

**All Your Time-Tossed Selves** by Porpentine (2016)
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScchacxWNnOHt6oMoXtU0vzOqeLFP7ZniPodGj81QrfdRvEcQ/viewform

An interactive narrative about a mysterious city's destruction where reader choices determine their escape plan, though all paths reveal the inevitable doom.

**Room #1** by Alex Saum (2020)
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZ4C9Q4i_KCwuDei2kK1SV7GyVQrWYozEavjbi-xpCqv55OA/viewform

Engages the reflective nature of the questionnaire form, highlighting the lack of transparency in online surveying and invisible digital processes.
