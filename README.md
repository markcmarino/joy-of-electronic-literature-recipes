# Joy of Electronic Literature Recipes

A collaborative cookbook documenting works of electronic literature as structured,
shareable recipes — submitted by the community via GitHub Pull Request.

## Contributing

Read the **[Participant Guide](PARTICIPANT_GUIDE.md)** for full instructions on
how to submit a recipe.

## How It Works

- Each recipe lives in `docs/recipes/` as a Markdown file
- Recipes have structured metadata (validated automatically) and a free-form body
- Submit your recipe by forking this repo and opening a Pull Request
- An automated check runs on every PR to validate the metadata — you'll see
  clearly what needs fixing if anything fails
- Once approved, recipes are merged and published to the project website
